*Option 1*

Go to the {{% resource_link "7f3fc56b-1e42-44c1-ac9b-1612805fdda0" "Civil Rights Movement Veterans" %}} website. Read two segments from "Our Stories" and two from "Our Thoughts." Then in your paper, just write what you read and if there is anything related to these pieces, anything from "{{% resource_link "64f9eb9f-4afb-423b-a686-588025439329" "Eyes on the Prize" %}}", or something about the US Civil Rights Movement that you want to know more about.

Go to {{% resource_link "b5f13d9d-f46a-414e-bb1f-9849e877471d" "American Experience's Eyes on the Prize" %}} website. Read one of the reflections and in your paper, write which one you read, your thoughts on their reflection (not a summary—your thoughts) and if there is something more you would like to know about this issue or anything else about the US Civil Rights Movement.
